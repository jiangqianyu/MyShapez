# MyShapez
In the fall of 2023, I took an advanced C++ programming course.The assignment for the course is to write a game similar to "Shapez". "Shapez" is a game about building a factory. In the game, players need to deliver increasingly complex shapes that meet certain requirements. They progress in the game and unlock upgrades to speed up their factory production. The game is relaxing, as players only need to construct the factory, set up facilities, and various geometric shapes are automatically created without any manual operation.

在2023年秋季，我学习了一门C++高级程序设计课程。课程的大作业是编写一个类似于《Shapez》的游戏。《Shapez》是一款关于建立工厂的游戏。在游戏中，玩家需要交付符合要求的越来越复杂的形状。他们在游戏中逐步进展，并解锁升级以加快工厂的生产速度。这款游戏很轻松，玩家只需要建造工厂，设置设施，各种各样的几何图形将自动创建，无需手动操作。
请下载build-MyShapez-Desktop_Qt_6_7_0_MinGW_64_bit-Debug文件夹，点击MyShapez.exe，即可进行游戏。
